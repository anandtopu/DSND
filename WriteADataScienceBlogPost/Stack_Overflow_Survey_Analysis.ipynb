    "Based on the data analysis of stack overflow surveys from 2015 to 2019, we can come up with observations as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.The most popular programming languages are JavaScript, HTML/CSS and SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.The most popular IDEs are Visual Studio, Notepad++ and sublime. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.North American developers have the highest average salary and relatively high salary increase rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.Professionals with advanced degrees are clearly earning more than those with only High School degree with the same years of Coding Experience However, as the years of experience increase, the difference becomes smaller.\n"
